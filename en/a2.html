							<p>I didn't know, but I'm really a hard-working person, and probably accomplished more work in the first three and a half years than any other president in history。”<p>

<p>On April 26, local time, the white house failed to hold a daily epidemic briefing for the second day in a row, but this did not affect the "information release" of US President trump. On the afternoon of April 26, trump released several tweets, continued to resent "false news", and said that some people said he was "the most diligent president in history". The day before, trump tweeted that "the briefing is not worth the time and effort."。<p>

<p>Trump wrote that day: "people who know me and know the history of our country say that I am the most diligent president in history. I didn't know, but I'm really a hard-working person, and probably did more work in the first three and a half years than any other president in history. Fake news (media) hate this!”</p>

							<p>He went on to write, "I've been working from morning to night, and I haven't left the White House for months to take care of trade agreements, military reconstruction, etc. (except to see off for the Navy hospital ship comfort), and then I read a false story about my work schedule and eating habits in the failed New York Times by a third rate journalist who didn't know me Written. I often go to the oval office late at night, read books, eat hamburgers and drink diet coke in my bedroom. People with me are always shocked. What's wrong with that!<p>

							<p>The White House did not hold a briefing on the epidemic. On that day, trump tweeted: it's not worth the time and effort! <p>
							<p>Trump did not hold a press briefing with the new coronavirus response task force at the White House on Saturday for the first time since the end of Easter (April 12), which may indicate a change in the frequency of the president's appearance in the coming weeks, the Capitol Hill reported on the 25th.<p>

							<p>The report said that novel coronavirus pneumonia and Trump, vice president Burns, have held nearly 50 White House news briefings since March, and have informed the government about the continuous response measures of the government to the new crown pneumonia epidemic. However, the 25th briefing was not held as usual. It is worth mentioning that the previous day's briefing was also "exceptionally short", lasting about 25 minutes. It is reported that Trump's briefing last Friday lasted about an hour and 45 minutes.<p>
							<p>U.S. News website Axios on Friday (24) quoted sources as saying that trump plans to shorten the duration of the briefing and reduce the number of appearances. Political news website politico reported that the White House coronavirus response working group may have held a private meeting, but did not hold a briefing.<p>
							<p>《国会山报》注意到，缩短简报会时长及25日未举行简报会，这些变化均出现在特朗普周四（23日）发表争议言论之后。<p>
							<p>在23日的简报会上，美国国土安全部（DHS）科学与技术局高级官员比尔布莱恩表示，样本实验表明，（一定的）阳光、高温或潮湿条件对病毒（繁殖）不利。布莱恩还说，消毒剂能在5分钟内杀死冠状病毒，异丙醇能在30秒内杀死病毒。<p>
							<p>随后，特朗普表示：“消毒剂在1分钟内就把它（病毒）灭了。有没有一种方法，我们可以通过注射或者说类似于清洗（的方法）来做类似的事情……尝试一下这样，可能会很有趣。”<p>
							<p>特朗普有关“注射消毒剂”的言论此后引起一些医学专家的质疑。白宫发言人和特朗普本人24日先后出面解释，特朗普表示自己只是在表达“讽刺”。不过美国舆论却不买账，纷纷摆出证据，强调总统提这一建议时是严肃认真的。<p>
							<p>关于简报会的相关情况，当地时间25日下午，白宫新闻秘书凯莉·麦克纳尼曾简短地谈及这一话题，但没有进一步透露简报会是会停止还是减少。“听着，我把这个问题留给总统，这完全是他的决定，但我相信，当总统直接向美国民众发表讲话时，他的状态是最好的。”<p>
							<p>《国会山报》称，麦克纳尼发声之后，大约过了45分钟，特朗普也在推特上就简报会相关情况发表了自己的意见。<p>
							<p>特朗普写道，“当差劲的媒体只会问一些充满敌意的问题，然后拒绝报道真相与准确的事实，那么召开白宫新闻发布会的目的又是什么？”“他们获得了创纪录的收视率，而美国人一无所得只收到假新闻。真不值得花费这些时间与精力！”<p>
